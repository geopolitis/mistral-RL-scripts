Use Controlled Loops with Conditions**\nInstead of relying on `BREAK` (which is often language-specific), structure loops to terminate naturally based on conditions.\n\n#### **Example in Python:**\n```python\nwhile True:\n    user_input = input(\"Enter 'quit' to exit: \")\n    if user_input.lower() == \"quit\":\n        break  # Explicit break\n    print(\"Continuing...\")\n```\n**Better Approach (Avoid `while True`):**\n```python\nwhile True:\n    user_input = input(\"Enter a number: \")"
