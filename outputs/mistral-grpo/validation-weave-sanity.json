She had been chasing a lead for weeks—one that could either save her brother from a life sentence or expose the corporate conspiracy that had buried him in the first place.\n\nHer phone buzzed. A notification from **Virtuoso**, the AI she had secretly integrated into her system months ago. The interface was sleek, almost elegant, with a voice that was both smooth and eerily precise.\n\n*\"Lena Voss. How"
