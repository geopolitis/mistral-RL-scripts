Your task is to generate the question for the answer based on the given article.\n\nInput: Article: Instead of a normal court hearing, the trial on Wednesday appeared more like a prepared drama. Hundreds of reporters waited outside the court, in the hope of learning \"shocking\" information about the case, which includes well-known military singer Li Shuangjiang's son, who gang-raped a woman with another four men on February. The case was not a public hearing because it includes teenagers, whose privacy must be protected under law, but many details had been exposed by the lawyers before the trial. Lawyers of all five suspects and the woman's lawyer made a lot of debate on the Internet before the trial, making the case more confused. Wu Ming'an, a law professor from the China University of Political Science and Law, said it was a pity to see such a \"performance\" by the lawyers. \"It can be understood that the two parties freely spoke their opinions, but it's not professional or wise to see lawyers do the same,\" Wu said. \"Instead, the lawyers should guide and persuade their clients  to calm down, especially for such a non-public and sensitive case.\" China has no clear rule to manage lawyers' behavior before trials, \"but it should be general knowledge that the lawyers of the two sides cannot _ too many details, particularly in a case that includes teenagers\", Wu added. Yi Shenghua, a lawyer who has been following the case, said it does more harm than good to both parties for such detailed information to be exposed before the trial. \"It's OK for lawyers to speak, but what is said must be reasonable and legal. Although judgments should not be affected by public opinion, it's hard for them not to be,\" he said, suggesting judicial authorities should speak out if the case goes wrongly. Trials must be conducted based on evidence, while lawyers should protect their clients' rights instead of adding fuel to the flames, Yi said. In my eyes, the most important aspect of the case, lies in how to make lawyers do their work more professionally and reasonably. \n Answer: Because many details had already been exposed before the trial.",

A: Some common baked goods include bread, cakes, cookies, pies, and pastries. Q: What are the basic ingredients for baking a cake? A: The basic ingredients for baking a cake are flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil, baking powder or baking soda, salt, and milk or water. Q: Can you give me a recipe for chocolate cake? A: Sure! Here's a simple recipe for chocolate cake: Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease two 9-inch (23cm) round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour, 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon baking soda. In another mixing bowl, whisk together 1 cup (240ml) vegetable oil, 2 large eggs, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, and 1 cup (115g) melted unsalted butter. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until combined. Stir in 1 cup (115g) semisweet chocolate chips. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and smooth the tops. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once the cakes are cooled, you can frost them with your favorite frosting and decorate as desired. Q: How long should I bake the cake for? A: The baking time for the chocolate cake is around 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Q: What temperature should I set my oven to when baking a cake?",

However, this cost is far outweighed by the following:\n- **E"
