Maybe you say no one likes making mistakes. But mistakes lead to growth. Converge Magazine recently published articles about mistakes students should make. It suggests students need to live a balanced life, even in the college environment. According to the topic of the article, there are four mistakes students should make. The mistakes include: Think they pick the wrong major   A student should explore any possibility that interests him, and future careers might just be around the corner. Remember, if you don't know what to do, it's OK! Think their teachers know everything Students may think of their teachers as gods who know everything, but that really is not the case. Students should know teachers are the ones who can help us understand better. Students can research answers on their own and get their own opinions instead of having their teachers tell them the answers. Think they get too involved Getting good grades is very important, but it's only a part of the life. Joining clubs and learning about social situations are all good for teenagers' growth.

You have to determine whether the Head can be characterized by being or having the Tail or not.
